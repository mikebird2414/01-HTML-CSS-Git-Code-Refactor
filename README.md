# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

Within the HTML5 file first the semantics were altered from "div" to header, nav, main, aside, section, and footer. THis was done to make the code more readable as to the locations where changes are made in CSS files. The alt tags were entered with more discriptive information to discribe the images placed wihtin the code. Commints were added to each semantic to sepperate the sections and changes within the html.

CSS file there were a few changes made with the adjustments of the HTML file. classes were made into elements to cut down on repeated classes.
